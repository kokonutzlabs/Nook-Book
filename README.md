# Nook-Book.SQL
Hello,
This is a side project I’m doing outside of my Business Programming II class to better understand how PHP and SQL work. As you can see on my repositories, I have experience in HTML/CSS and wanted to make 
something else involving them, so I’m doing this. I wanted to build someone their own site, and they wanted it to be Animal Crossing themed, so after taking this class I came up with a social site similar 
to Facebook. I want to build this as I learn, making it more interactive by adding features like creating your own account, going to your home page, and viewing others’ pages.

During this project, I started off writing raw SQL, but when it wasn’t working, I switched to using phpMyAdmin.
###### **!!This project is not finished, so enjoy what I have done so far!!**
## File Explainations:
#### HTML
##### **nook-book.html:** Displays one villagers profile where you can only interact with their posts at this time.
#### PHP
##### **nook-book1.php:** Temporarily holds user interactions and shows a confirmation message when an action (vote, reaction, or comment) is submitted.
##### **nook-book2.php:** Connects PHP to a MySQL database. User actions (votes, reactions, and comments) are now saved in the database instead of being temporary. Each submission is confirmed with an on screen message.
#### SQL
##### **nook-book.sql:** Stores user data received from PHP, allowing the site to remember votes, reactions, and comments.
## Programs Used:
- VS Code
- XAMPP
- phpMyAdmin
## Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- MySQL
## Sources I've Used:
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [PHP TUTORIAL](https://www.phptutorial.net/php-tutorial/php-radio-button/)
## How To View The Site
#### Option One:
###### If it's still up, you can view the project through my [Neocities Page](https://fuzzykokonutz.neocities.org/). It is in the project section of the page and is the first link on the list. But you will not be able to use the interactions, since it doesn't allow backend.
#### Option Two:
- 1.Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (this gives you a local host to run the php and mysql files)
- 2.Download each file I provided. (if you want the social experience, exclude nook-book.php)
- 3.Create and name a folder to put the downloaded files in. (save it in the local host files)
- 4.After setting up your XAMPP, open it and start the Apache and MySQL.
- 5.Open your browser and enter ex.) localhost/(whatever the folder name is) in the search bar.
- 6.When the local host is open, click on the nook-book.html file. (Viola, enjoy! ⸂⸂⸜(രᴗര๑)⸝⸃⸃ )

## Updates 
1. I plan on adding an SQL database to this project, so you can do each interaction without being brought to a new screen.  11/6/25
2. I will finish up the css sometime this month. 11/12/25
3. I'm thinking of adding more profiles to look at, but it's a maybe right now. 11/10/25
